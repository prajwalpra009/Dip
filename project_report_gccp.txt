Project Report: Hosting a Website on Google Cloud Bucket and Using HTTP Load Balancer

Introduction:
In this project, we will host a website on a Google Cloud Bucket and use an HTTP load balancer to distribute traffic to the website. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to host a website on the cloud and improve its availability and scalability.

Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Bucket
The first step in hosting a website on the Google Cloud is to create a bucket. A bucket is a container for storing and managing files on the cloud. To create a bucket, follow these steps:

Go to the Google Cloud Console
Click on the Storage option in the navigation menu
Click on the "+ Create Bucket" button
Enter a name for the bucket, select a storage class, and a location
Click on the "Create" button
Step 2: Upload Website files
Once you have created a bucket, you can upload the files for your website to it. You can do this using the Google Cloud Console, the gsutil command-line tool, or a third-party tool such as Cyberduck.

Step 3: Configure the Bucket for Website Hosting
After uploading the files for your website, you will need to configure the bucket for website hosting. To do this, follow these steps:

Go to the Google Cloud Console
Click on the Storage option in the navigation menu
Click on the name of the bucket you just created
Click on the "Edit" button
Scroll down to the "Website Configuration" section
Enter the name of the index file (index.html)
Click on the "Save" button
Step 4: Create an HTTP Load Balancer
The next step is to create an HTTP load balancer. A load balancer is a service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, improving the availability and scalability of the website. To create an HTTP load balancer, follow these steps:

Go to the Google Cloud Console
Click on the Network Services option in the navigation menu
Click on the "Load balancers" option
Click on the "+ Create" button
Select "HTTP(S) Load Balancer"
Configure the load balancer settings
Click on the "Create" button
Step 5: Configure the Load Balancer
After you have created the load balancer, you will need to configure it. This includes adding the bucket as a backend service and configuring the load balancing rules. To do this, follow these steps:

Go to the Google Cloud Console
Click on the Network Services option in the navigation menu
Click on the "Load balancers" option
Click on the name of the load balancer you just created
Click on the "Edit" button
Scroll down to the "Backend configuration" section
Add the bucket as a backend service
Scroll down to the "Host and path rules" section
Configure the load balancing rules
Click on the "Save" button
Step 6: Testing the Website
After completing the above steps, the website should be accessible via the domain name provided by Load Balancer. Test the website by opening the website url on a web browser.

Conclusion:
Hosting a website on a Google Cloud Bucket and using an HTTP load balancer is a cost-effective and scalable solution for hosting a website. By following the steps outlined in this report, you should be able to
